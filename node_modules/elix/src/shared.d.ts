 * is important because a mixin may be applied not just to HTMLElement, but to
 * a subclass of HTMLElement (often created by other mixins). The type
 * information about that input subclass should transfer to the mixin's output.
 * That ensures the use of the mixin doesn't accidentally hide members of the
 * class passed to the mixin.
 *
 * A mixin can declare optional expectations it has about its base class
 * (usually properties or methods which might be present, but which are not
 * required), as well as declare the set of any members the mixin adds to the
 * class it returns.
 *
 * Often, a member will appear in both the set of base expectations and the set
 * of members the mixin defines. Suppose a mixin defines a `foo` property. The
 * mixin might the say, "The base class I'm given _may_ have a foo property. The
 * class I return will _definitely_ have a foo property."
